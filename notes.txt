Assignment New and Create:

creating a model - "Product" with three attributes => title, description and price.

The Product model file and folder are created in console - 'bin/rails g model product title:string description:text price:float'

The attributes are genreally a hash item i.e. defining the key item and the type of value it will be (string, text, float, timestamps). 

This will generate and populate the necessary files and folder in the project.

In the console enter bin/rake db:migrate to create the 'Product' table / database.

once that is set up the Products controller needs to be generated, this is done in the console: 'bin/rails g controller products' ** NOTE THE CONTROLLER IS SINGULAR AND PRODUCT IS PLURAL**

To start, first configur the routes.db with new action 'get "/productS/new" => "productS#new", as: :new_product"
** THE FIRST TWO ARE ALWAYS PLURAL AND THE LAST ONE IS SIGNULAR. WITH AN EXCEPTION **

'post "/productS" => "productS#create", as: :productS'

create the home page = 'root "home#index", as: :home'
